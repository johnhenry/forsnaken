        // a function into which we will pass the output our game to be rendered

        // The **canvas** is place in the HTML code where we will render our game.
        // We've given it an id of "snake" and so that we can reference it in our code.
        const canvas = document.getElementById("snake");

        // Render setup involves creating a **renderer** that will be used to render
        // the output of the **gameInstance** object (created in the next chapter) on to the aforementioned **canvas**.

        // Our **renderer** will actually be a combination of two renderers:
        // one concrened with rendering the game to a canvas context;
        // another concerned with rendering effects on the HTML elemetn

        // Before we create the **canvasRenderer**, we want to know the width and heigh
        // of the object upon which we're drawing, **canvaswidth** and **canvasheight**,
        // respective. Note that we set these in the HTML as a practical measure to avoid flash, and are resetting them here for demonstration purposes.

        const canvaswidth = (canvas.width = 800);
        // const canvasWidth = 800;// already set in HTML to prevent flash
        const canvasheight = (canvas.height = 400); // = 400;// already set in HTML to prevent flash
        // const canvasheight = 400;// already set in HTML to prevent flash

        // Next we need to create a **zoom**.
        // This is an integer how "zoomed-in" a game will be when used to draw a game on a canvas.
        // In order to make the game fit into the drawable areas, both the
        // **canvaswidth** and **canvasheight** are scaled down by this number when making
        //  calculations within the game.
        // For example, with a zoom of 1, 1 unit in the game would be drawn over a 1x1 (1) pixel square
        //              with a zoom of 8, 1 unit in the game would be drawn over a 8x8 (64) pixel square
        // We've picked 8, but as long as it's a divisor of both **canvaswidth** and **canvasheight**, it will work.

        // The objective of this section is to prepare **gameInstance**,
        // an iterator whose values represent the current state of the game.

        // Before creating the game, we scale down **canvaswidth** and **canvasheight** by a factor of **zoom** in order to make the game calculations match the renderer.
        // We call these  **width** and **height** respectively.

        // The game calls for a specific quantity called **appleNumber** that representes the number of apples randomly distributed throught the game world. We've chosen an  calculation based on height and width to ensure that this number is around 1% of the total game area.
